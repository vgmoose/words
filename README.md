## Description
This application is inspired by the counter on [NaNoWriMo.org](http://nanowrimo.org)'s website during novel writing month. The intent of this tool is to help writers keep a running tally of their personal writing, even outside of National Novel Writing Month.

## Technology
The Word Counter saves word counts to the browser's [Local Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage#localStorage). As such, it provides a "backup" feature to allow exporting/importing in case cookies need to be cleared or web browsers changed. 

The library [canvasjs](http://canvasjs.com) is used to render the chart.
